JS-VIDEO
========

A super simple HTML5 video player

How
---

To use, include the javascript in the bottom of your HTML :

        <script src="video.js"> </script>
        <script>
            var display = document.getElementById('display');
            upVideo.setup(display);
            upVideo.loadVideo('trailer_400p');
        </script>

Above example inserts video player into an empty DIV with the id "display"
